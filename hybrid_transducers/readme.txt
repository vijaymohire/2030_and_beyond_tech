Hybrid Quantum Transducers: Newer interfaces across various physical media and protocol  stacks like transducers from microwaves, infrared couplers, frequency, amplitude, phase detector resonance cavity couplers,
optical and classical fibres for qubit bridging like superconductors, trapped ions, artificial atoms, photons etc 

For example, Harvard has developed a photon based router:
