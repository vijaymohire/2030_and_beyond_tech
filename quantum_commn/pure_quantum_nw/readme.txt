This is a research based quantum networks that has been used by various R&D labs and research centers. These typically have various functions that can be leveraged by the, integrated quantum internet,allowing for 
easier scaling using classical protocols and certain quantum functions that are incldued along the classical protocol stack that allow for easier and more secure classical communciation.
