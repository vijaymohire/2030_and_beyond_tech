This offers the state-of-the art integration of the classical internet with the quantum nw that has been researched. This offers integration of every OSI stack layer with the quantum NW protocols and proposed layers.

This will be the NISQ era NW that offers immense opportunites to mix and match the needs for various industries including IIoT, satellite commn, submarine cables, point to point communications like the 6G, space communications that need quantum sensing and edge computing using classical AI nodes etc
