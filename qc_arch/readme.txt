Few steps:

Have a Cmdb with all these domains and technology base focused on QAI under various capacities from mobile based computing ,laptop, edge, server and Supercomputer. Start with Excel sheet and move that to a Cmdb. 

Once domain needs and technology base is identified, solutions to domain needs are developed. 

Also add state of art issues related to domains, projects, real world issues, and these needs are to be addressed by unique technology and scientific solutions.

Use a simple Gui to interface these db with gui for admin and use as Master DB and Admin.
