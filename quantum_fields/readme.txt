Quantum Field Theories and related research that offers the transofrmation and quantization of the waves to fields. These lead to the newer areas for new age communication systems design.

Classically, we have learned about electromagnetics, fields and signal propagation using optical and free space as provided by various classical theories by Dirac, Maxwell, Gauss, Faraday etc most of these assume propagation of local field using transmitter to a remote receiver. You might have also used transistors, signal amplifiers, signal mux, demux, various types of analog and digital chips for trans receiving signals. QFT is a newer paradigm that considers non-locality, systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and offers various theories related to Gauges (Yang-Mills), Spinors (Dirac), Scalars (Klein-Gordon), Strings (Conformal Field theory), Quantum electrodynamics (QED) etc. More in these links:

Here is a nice informative course to start learning Quantum Field Theory (QFT) at MIT OCW, course name: Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I-8.323. More details in the website: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/8-323-relativistic-quantum-field-theory-i-spring-2023/ . 

Key courses are: 
1.	Quantum Theory I -8.321
2.	Quantum Theory II -8.322
3.	Relativistic Quantum Field Theory I-8.323
4.	Relativistic Quantum Field Theory II-8.324
5.	String Theory and Holographic Duality-8.8.821

Advanced theories leverage on two or more attributes like differing theories, weak and strong interactions, relativity, Einstein's curved space-time equations, anti-de Sitter/conformal field theory, holograms based quantum algorithms, QEC, holographic computing instead of state-of-art qubits are being researched that can offer the inclusion of higher dimensions like the quantum gravity for lesser errors and computing needs. 

I am sure getting the basics will help the next generation engineers in designing quantum age antennas and signal processors
