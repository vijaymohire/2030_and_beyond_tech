Computational_paradigms folder holds the NextGen Computational models, improved speed, using lesser energy, dynamically scaling in many dimensions, self-repair and RL that allows for self-aware self-directed human goal reaching systems. 

Here is an interesting resource on "Processing Units" related to Computers. There is plenty of scope to conduct deep research on the computational models and use of QAI technologies can surely help in getting an optimal model for an use case, using various co-design and simulations. 

As far I remember, I wish to add few related terms to this just for a refresh (not an exhaustive list):Scalar and Vector computing, Tensors, Hi dimensional computing, Hi performance computing, Computational Graphs, Constrained resource computing (example, limited memory), multi-cores, multi-threaded, virtual core/ threads, big data computing, multi-modal computing, hyper-scalars, edge computing, in-memory computing, real-time computing, batch computing, supercomputer staged pipeline computing, linear, non-linear computing, NUMA computing, MPP, Delta Computing, non-blocking I/O computing, distributed computing, context level computing, intelligent computing, peripheral computing, autonomous computing, computing machines, computing models, hi-level, low-level, platform agnostic computing, classical-quantum hybrid computing, LLM training, server-less computing, head-less node computing etc etc. Computing is present every where, where data is available.
However, use of a proper model and platform can help in saving energy and do the same task in a shorter time. Risks related to increased use of computation can involve: Junk In Junk Out, Identity theft, Data leaks, heated processors leading to causalities, high operational costs, idling of processors, non productive hours, health hazards (no proper management, staff laid off), no buyers, not eco friendly etc. So, careful planning of use of resources can be beneficial.
So the right blend of technology, common sense and merit of needs and use can lead to sustainable use of technologies that are compute intensive.
