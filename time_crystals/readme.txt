Time crystals, and Space-Time crystals, emerge from exotic state of matter that promise solutions to various quantum problems like decoherence and quantum memory. More details in the article.
Researchers are developing the space time crystals in the lab and this can lead to newer ways of quantum computing which can leverage the lifespan of about 40 minutes without any external energy. Lot more research is needed, as this is a lab experiment and study and integration with 3D scales, symmetry, exotic matter analysis, coherence time, how the base states are formed and used for computing and memory, all needs a lot of dedication and leadership skills to deep dive.
