This is the SYK model based holographic quantum system with features like event horizon, singularity, cosmic memory, entanglement etc that is an alternative to the qubit technology.

Holographic_Quantum_System Jupyter notebook holds the first example. The results from this is held in: teleported_results.xlsx. This system has a lesser fidelity of about 53%, however 
can be increased based on circuit elements, tensor networks, QEC, holograhic algorithms etc
