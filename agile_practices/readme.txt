Agile Practices related files for design, development of software and systems for the QAI era.  Example is crypto agility. 

Crypto-agility, a name that stems from agile methodologies for software development, means the ability to modify quickly and securely cryptographic algorithms in the event of a compromise.Software development has gone through various SDLC models like waterfall, iterative, prototype, spiral, V model, agile etc. Agile methods and frameworks like Kanban, SAFe, Scrum etc are widely used in complex software projects unlike the old age standard complicated projects using waterfall. Quantum product can have many unknowns and thus needs research along with agile methods to reach goals as written in the vision or high level project objectives.
Especially, being agile and proactive can help a lot in keeping assets safe. Quantum cryptography also needs these, as newer algorithm versions and methods need placeholders that allow for dynamic replacements and deployment making the intrusion not a success. This can be applied even to various other strategies like a winning game plan, winning strategy or even better use QAI for intelligent research and finding the impossible.
