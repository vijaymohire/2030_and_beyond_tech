Advances in QEC that provides better QEC Codes. 

QEC codes are very important that can help progress the NISQ era technology to a more fault tolerant quantum computing. An interesting article by O‚ÄôReilly. üëè 
I feel errors are present everywhere and a need to address it end to end might help; may be a lifecycle model that covers right from the quantum material selection, nano scale fabrication, engineering , software, hardware elements as a system unit, systems engineering, Gen AI tools to find the best placements, hybrid qubits that use topological immunity, artificial immunity using degenerate states, hyperfine energy bands, use of copackaged optics, entangled network, use of integrated technologies as redundancy, quantum simulation, quantum memory like use of spintronics, distillation, rejection of noise using HW, SW filters, better codes, etc can benefit in reducing the error. Also constructive feedback and critic on existing practices, hiring policies, engineering methods can help.
Below are Moody's quantum computing‚Äôs six most important trends üìâ for 2025, QEC is one topic that spans many points. More details: https://lnkd.in/gnjuHrct
 
1Ô∏è‚É£ More experiments with logical qubits
2Ô∏è‚É£ More specialized hardware/software (as opposed to universal quantum computing)
3Ô∏è‚É£ More networking noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices together
4Ô∏è‚É£ More layers of software abstraction
5Ô∏è‚É£ More workforce development tools
6Ô∏è‚É£ Improved and novel physical qubits
