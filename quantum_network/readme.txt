Quantum NW that offers entangled networks using swapping that allows for repeater-like signal amplificaiton and distillation.

The classical OSI layers model is a very complex one and may not be suitable for the quantum internet, either reusing, modifying the layers or overlayed protocols. Moreover, the principles are very different, and various limitations like no-cloning can make the repeater design not good. Also for various errors related to physical media, logical layers there is a need for different types of QEC codes for quantum communications that can be derived from the newer theories related to quantum communications, field theory, channels, entropy, modulations, etc. Optical fiber is one promising media that use photons for modulation, entanglement, error correction, amplification etc
